# Videogame-Playtime-Statistics-Dataset-Analysis
These datasets shows playtime statistics for games that are standalone singleplayer games, multiplayer-focused games, and co-op games. It even includes DLC expansions of games and their playtime statistics as well. There are two CSV files containing a dataset, of which, I will examine just the csv file, hltb_dataset_filtered.csv, a dataset with only full standalone games with recorded playtimes. 
     I find this interesting because I like video games and I want to know the playtime statistics for games that have singleplayer and co-op and I want to know how they differ. 
     My goal is to track games with singleplayer and co-op and find how the playtimes of games change  over time from the 90s to the 2000s to the 2010s to the 2020s in their singleplayer and co-op playtime statistics.
